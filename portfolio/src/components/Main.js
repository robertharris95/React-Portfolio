                A bit about myself. I am a graduate of Rice University, Houston native, and all around lover of all things Texas.
                I specialize in the MEAN and MERN stacks for developing robust web applications for personal or business use.
                When not developing, I love spending time with my fianc√© Breanna, playing with my bulldog Chuck, and eating any and every thing Houston has to offer.
